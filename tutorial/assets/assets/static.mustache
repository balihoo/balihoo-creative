  <p class="lead">Any part of your site that isn't dynamically rendered <em>.mustache</em> is a static asset.</p>

  <h3 id="static-files">Static Files</h3>
  <p>Static assets include images, JavaScript files, style-sheets, and any other asset used in your design. Static assets should only include the final, compiled versions of your assets. Please do not include source files in your <code>assets/</code> directory. For example, if you are using Sass to build your CSS files, please do not include your Sass files or any preprocessing directives or Makefiles, just include the end product <em>.css</em> file. The same goes for any other pre-processing including minifiers, uglifiers, premailer, etc. Only include the final, production-ready files in your <code>assets</code> directory. See also <a href="#source-control">Source Control</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="static-file-layout">Static File Layout</h3>
  <p>All of your project's asset files will reside under the <code>assets/</code> directory. When you run the <code>balihoo-creative</code> app it will scan your assets and organize them into an object that mimicks their directory organization. Take another look at our example asset layout used in this tutorial:</p>
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code>{{> assets-directory}}</code></pre></div>

  <p>Note that <code>balihoo.png</code> is located under <code>assets/img/</code>. So, when you want to reference our logo file within a mustache template you would do the following:
{{=<% %>=}}
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-mustache" data-lang="mustache">&lt;img src={{assets.img.balihoo_png}}/&gt;</code></pre></div>
<%={{ }}=%>

  <p>Note that the extension <em>.png</em> is referenced with an underscore instead of a dot. It would be possible to create a collision if you had for example a file named balihoo.png and balihoo_png (no extension).  Don't do that.</p>
  <p>All dots in a file name will be converted to underscores when referenced in a mustache template, so you could serve a file at <code>assets/css/brand.css.map</code> with the tag <code>assets.css.brand_css_map</code></p>
