Balihoo Web Designer Toolkit 
============================

`balihoo-creative` allows web and interactive designers to build customizable templates
on their own workstation, using their favorite editors and compile tools. It integrates
with Balihoo's online resources like Form-Builder & BLIP to make template design and
maintenance a seemless, painless experience.

## Version
0.0.26

## Installation
  Make sure you have a recent version of node and npm installed and
  then run:
  ```shellscript
  sudo npm -g install balihoo-creative
  ```
  If npm is installed as root then you may have to run it using sudo.

## Updating
  To update to the most recent version run:
  ```shellscript
  sudo npm -g update balihoo-creative
  ```

## Usage

  The app contains its own extensive documentation and tutorial. To view the docs
  and tutorial: first, install the app, create an empty directory and run the app
  within that directory.
  ```shellscript
  mkdir /tmp/project
  cd /tmp/project
  balihoo-creative
  ```
  Running the app in an empty directory will generate the tutorial project in that
  directory, run the web server, and open your browser to the *Getting Started*
  tutorial page.
